So to this first project I used the "transformers" library to get my answers form the internet

In the list for library to AI development we got:
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
xgboost
lightgbm
tensorflow
keras
torch
torchvision
nltk
spacy
transformers
opencv-python
flask
joblib

All these library have a useful function in AI and are written in Python
